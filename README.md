mobile-device-browser
=====================

This is most of the code to power http://www.mobiledevicebrowser.com

The site was abandoned after a licensing change for the mobile device database, but I left it up for the curious.


Missing from this repo are a couple of the dependencies which you can find elsewhere:

  * PrototypeJS (http://prototypejs.org)
  * DHTMLX (http://dhtmlx.com)
  
They both would sit in the js directory.
